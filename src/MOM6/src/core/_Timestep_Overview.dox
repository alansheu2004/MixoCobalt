/*! \page Timestep_Overview Timestepping Overview

In MOM6, it is common to have at least four different timesteps: the barotropic
timestep, the baroclinic (momentum dynamics) timestep, the tracer timestep, and the
remapping interval. There can also be a forcing timestep on which model coupling occurs.
