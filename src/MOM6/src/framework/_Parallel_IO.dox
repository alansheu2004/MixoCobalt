\brief Parallel I/O

The model can be told to write a different output file per process. This may or may
not save time, and is a bad idea on Lustre filesystems. If the model is writing
individual files per process, one can combine them using the mppnccombine program from
the [FRE-nctools package](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FRE-NCtools).
