# MOM6 APIs

This is the generated documentation for the NCAR fork of MOM6 source code which describes the APIs as well as some features of the code.

See the [quick start guide](https://github.com/ESCOMP/MOM_interface/wiki/Quick-Start) for more information on how to run MOM6 within the CESM framework.

This documentation is also available as web-linkable pages hosted on [read the docs](http://mom6ncar.readthedocs.io/), where the pages are generated with sphinx.
